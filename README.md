# TemperatureControlledFan
This is a project coded in C++ (in the Arduino IDE). It needs a DHT11 sensor, an Arduino, a Blue LED, a red LED and a potentiometer to operate.
You will also need to download the DHT Sensor Library at https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/dht-sensor-library  .

The project is controlled by the temperature and the potentiometer has 5 stages. The code has many comments and explains itself well.
A build video may be uploaded soon to this youtube channel:
